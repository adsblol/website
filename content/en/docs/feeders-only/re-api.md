You can access the API at the following address: <https://re-api.adsb.lol>

This is the readsb API of our entire network, unfiltered and unmodified.

It is only accessible by your station's IP address, so if you want to access it from another location, you will need to use a VPN, or a proxy.

### Usage

See [docs](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb/blob/dev/README-json.md#--net-api-port-query-formats)

For example,

<https://re-api.adsb.lol?circle=52,2,200>
