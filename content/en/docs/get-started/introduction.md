## Feed ADSB.lol

Adding a receiver to our network is easy. You can use any of the following methods:

### [ADSB.im Image](../adsb-image)

Recommended for new stations / easy.

Simple to use ADSB Feeder Images for common Single Board Computers.

### [ADSB.lol Docker Toolkit](../docker)

Recommended for new stations / expert.

Install, run and maintain a ADS-B / UAT / MLAT / ACARS / VDL2 / AIS feed client to a multitude of aggregators.

### [Bare Metal](../bare-metal)

Recommended for existing stations.

If you already have an ADS-B station, you can add ADSB.lol as a feeder, this will not interfere with your existing setup.

All you need is BEAST out on port 30005.
